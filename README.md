# 🏗️ QA Career Intelligence: Architect Command Center

A high-integrity, automated system designed for **Senior SDETs** and **Test Architects** to orchestrate career growth through verified job signal discovery and zero-hallucination resume optimization.

## 🌟 Core Philosophy: "The Lead Architect Standard"
- **Integrity Lock**: Career artifacts are strictly generated as a semantic subset of the Master Source. We do not fabricate; we re-architect.
- **Signal Legitimacy**: Direct ingestion from Tier 1 (Greenhouse/Lever) syncs ensure that 100% of pursued opportunities are verified active.
- **Precision Engineering**: Leverages **Gemini 3 Pro** with a 32k thinking budget to ensure structural alignment and logic verification.

## 🚀 Key System Modules
1. **Ranked Signal Feed**: Real-time discovery across 4 tiers of legitimacy, with automated "Ghost Job" de-prioritization.
2. **Resume Optimizer (FastAPI Node)**: A high-precision endpoint enforcing strict token intersection between Job Descriptions and your Master Inventory.
3. **Compliance Hub**: Mandatory safety guardrails (PII Audit, Hallucination Lock) that must be cleared before artifact release.
4. **Scraper Lab**: A sandbox environment for auditing and simulating the Playwright-driven discovery agents.
5. **Architect Blueprints**: Direct access to the underlying Python source code and system master blueprints.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
- **Intelligence**: Google Gemini 3 Pro (Principal Tier) @ Temperature 0.2.
- **Infrastructure Blueprint**: FastAPI (Python), Pydantic v2, PostgreSQL, Playwright.
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Railway (Backend) and Vercel (Frontend).
