## Personnel Engagement & Negotiation Framework

### 1. Outreach Personas
The system dynamically suggests templates based on the company's "Persona Hint."

- **Frontier (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI)**: 
    - **Focus**: Research integrity, LLM evaluation, and safety-first testing.
    - **Tone**: Academic-Professional.
- **Infrastructure (e.g., Stripe, AWS)**: 
    - **Focus**: Idempotency, scale, schema evolution, and platform reliability.
    - **Tone**: Engineering-Centric.
- **Standard (e.g., Series B/C Startups)**: 
    - **Focus**: Speed-to-market, framework ROI, and quality-gate automation.
    - **Tone**: Agile-Strategic.

### 2. Negotiation Guardrails
- **The "High-Signal" Advantage**: Use the "Verified" status of other signals to drive urgency.
- **4-Year Value Modeling**: Always calculate Base + Bonus + (Equity * Growth_Multiplier) before responding to offers.
- **Equity Audit**: Request strike prices and current preferred valuation for Option-based grants to assess real risk.

### 3. Response Templates
- **Signal Recovery**: For ghosted signals or stale applications.
- **Offer Calibration**: For re-aligning total comp with the "Test Architect" value proposition.
